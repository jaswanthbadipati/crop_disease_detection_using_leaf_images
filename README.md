## About The Project

Crop diseases cause significant agricultural losses. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify leaf images as healthy or diseased. A Streamlit app allows users to upload an image and get disease predictions instantly.

### Key Features
- Automated disease detection
- High accuracy using CNN architecture
- Streamlit-based user-friendly interface

---

## Dataset
**PlantVillage Dataset**  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset

- ~54,000 images
- Multiple disease classes

---

## Built With

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy / Pandas
* Streamlit
* Matplotlib

---

## Getting Started

### Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Usage
1. Launch Streamlit
2. Upload a leaf image
3. View disease prediction

---

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Training Accuracy | ~95-98% |
| Validation Accuracy | ~90-95% |

---

## Roadmap
- [x] Train CNN Model
- [x] Build Streamlit UI
- [ ] Add treatment suggestions
- [ ] Deploy to Cloud
